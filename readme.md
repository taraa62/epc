How does it run?

- download files from `/prod`
- run command: `docker-compose up -d`

--- 

Filter large file:

- go to browser by link: `http://localhost:8082/`
- select file and submit

Other endpoints:

- go by link to swagger `http://localhost:8082/api/`
- don't forget: /register => /login (copy access token to authorize field)

P/S :)
